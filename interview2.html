1.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods.
Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.
Apply invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
Bind returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.

2.Explain prototypes
The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript

3.What are promises and why do we need them?
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

4.What are function constructors?
the Function constructor creates a new Function object. Calling the constructor directly can create functions dynamically

5.What is hoisting?
the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code

6.What is the DOM?
Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document

7.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
null is an object with a valid non-existent value and it is non-mutable while object type of an undefined value is in itself undefined

8.What are pure functions?
A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.

9.How many operators do we have in JS ?
JavaScript Operators are as rich as what you'd expect from any modern language. There are four categories: arithmetic, comparison, assignment, and logical.

10.What is the purpose of async/await keywords?
The async keyword turns a method into an async method, which allows you to use the await keyword in its body

11.What is an event loop and call stack
The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run

12.What is prototype chain
all the objects in JavaScript, inherit the properties and methods from Object. prototype. This is called Prototype chaining.

13.What is the use of setTimeout
setTimeout() The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires
function greet() {
    alert('Welcome!');
   }
   setTimeout(greet, 2000); //execute greet after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)

14.Callback function
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete

function greeting(name) {
    alert('Hello ' + name);
  }
  
  function processUserInput(callback) {
    var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
    callback(name);
  }
  
  processUserInput(greeting);

15.What is callback hell JavaScript
Callback hell is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous operations one after the other. By nesting callbacks
